* Stimmung, Emacs tuned to inner harmines

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When you say: We're in a good /Stimmung/, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.

/Stimmung-themes/ is a pair of monoesuqe Emacs themes with minimal syntax highlighting. They are inspired by [[https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster][Tonsky's Alabaster theme]], following the maxim that a theme that highlights everything paradoxically highlights nothing. Text backgrounds (comments, strings and constants) and font variations (definitions/callsites) are used as alternatives to text colors, ensuring a harmonious reading experience. The hues of the /stimmung-dark/ are selected to match the default macOS dark mode. The themes feature a (default golden beige) highlight color that you can set with the variables ~stimmung-themes-light-highlight-color~ and ~stimmung-themes-dark-highlight-color~ respectively.

Emacs packages often define their own faces, making theming a relatively sisyphean task. /Stimmung-themes/ defines all default faces and some of the most common packages, including lsp-mode and magit. Open an issue or make pull request if you lack a definition, they are always appreciated!

** Installation
[[https://melpa.org/#/stimmung-themes][Stimmung-themes is distributed via MELPA]]. Install it with your package manager of preference (~package.el~, ~straight~, ~use-package~) and make sure the following lines are in your init-file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'stimmung-themes) ; if you use package.el
(load-theme 'stimmung-themes-light)
#+END_SRC

A typical use-package installation might look something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package stimmung-themes
  ;; :straight (stimmung-themes :host github :repo "motform/stimmung-themes") ; if you are a straight shooter
  :demand t
  :ensure t
  :config (load-theme 'stimmung-themes-light t))
#+END_SRC
