* Stimmung, a theme tuned to inner harmonies

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When you say: We're in a good /Stimmung/, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.

  /Stimmung/ is a pair of monochrome-ish Emacs themes with minimal syntax highlighting. They are inspired by [[https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster][Tonsky's Alabaster theme]], similarly arguing that excessive highlighting paradoxically hides syntactic distinctions. Unlike Tonksy, I find the use of bold and italic fonts rather pleasant. As such, font variations are employed those conservatively throughout the theme. The hues of the /Stimmung/ are selected to match the default MacOS dark mode.

  If something looks off, you can report it as an issue. I have only tested it against [[https://github.com/motform/emacs.d][my personal configuration]], so there will probably be a few holes here and there. The modeline in the screenshot is from [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][Doom Emacs]] and the type is set in [[https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/][PragmataPro]].

** Installation
   The theme is not on melpa (yet), so you have to clone the repository and manually require it in your ~init~.el.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (load "*PATH-TO-.EL*")
   (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "*PATH-TO-FOLDER-CONTANING-.EL*")
   (load-theme 'stimmung t)
   #+END_SRC

** Customization
   The highlight color of each theme can be set by ~stimmung-theme-dark-highlight-color~ and ~stimmung-theme-light-highlight-color~, respectively.
