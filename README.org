* Stimmung, Emacs tuned to inner harmines

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When you say: We're in a good /Stimmung/, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.

  /Stimmung/ is a pair of monochrome-ish Emacs themes with minimal syntax highlighting. They are inspired by [[https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster][Tonsky's Alabaster theme]], following the maxim that a theme that highlights everything paradoxically highlights nothing. Text backgrounds (comments, strings and constants) and font variations (definitions) are used as alternatives to text colors, ensuring a harmonious reading experience. The hues of the /stimmung-dark/ are selected to match the default MacOS dark mode.

  Emacs packages often define their own faces, making theming a relatively sisyphean task. /Stimmung/-themes defines all default faces and some of the most common packages. It is have only tested it against [[https://github.com/motform/emacs.d][my personal configuration]], so there will probably be a missing definitions.
