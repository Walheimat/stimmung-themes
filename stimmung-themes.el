;;; Commentary:

;; Stimmung (dark and light) is a pair of monochrome Emacs themes
;; with minimal syntax highlighting.  They are inspired by Tonsky's
;; Alabaster theme (https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster),
;; similarly arguing that excessive highlighting paradoxically hides
;; syntactic distinctions.  Unlike Tonksy, I find the use of bold and
;; italic fonts rather pleasant.  As such, bold and italic font
;; variations are employed those conservatively throughout the theme.
